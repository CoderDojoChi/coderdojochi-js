Challenge:

Now we know how to draw basic shapes let's try to draw something!
Let's draw a "neutral" smiley face. 
See examples here: http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f610

Bonus: how could we add 2 front teeth to our smiley?

var setup = function() {
  	createCanvas(600, 600);
};

var draw = function() {
	// use a circle as the face
	ellipse(300, 300, 200, 200);
	
	// eyes

	// mouth
};
